## 🚀 Why add this bot?

🧵 **Private Threads System**
Say goodbye to cluttered ticket channels! When a user opens a ticket, the bot creates a **Private Thread**.
* **Confidential:** Only the user and the Staff team can see the conversation.
* **Organized:** All tickets are neatly tucked away under a single channel, keeping your server list clean.

📡 **Live FiveM Status**
The bot constantly monitors your server's IP and displays the **Live Player Count** (e.g., `Watching Players: 64/128`) directly in its status.

🎛️ **One-Click Panel**
Automatically deploys a professional, permanent dashboard with buttons for:
* 🧰 **General Support**
* 🚨 **Player Reports**
* 🐞 **Bug Reports**
